## Open/Closed Principle

The Open/Closed Principle is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, and it states that software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be **open for extension but closed for modification**. This means that you should be able to add new functionality by extending the code without modifying existing code, which reduces the risk of introducing bugs in a stable system.

In your Rust code, you have implemented the `Subscriber` trait to achieve the Open/Closed Principle by defining a general contract for `calculate_bill` in a trait and then creating specific implementations for different types of subscribers (`PhoneSubscriber` and `ISPSubscriber`) without needing to change the original `Subscriber` trait or `SubscriberDetails` struct.

### Code Analysis in Light of the Open/Closed Principle

Let's walk through the code with the Open/Closed Principle in mind.

#### 1. Defining the Trait (`Subscriber`) as the Extension Point

```rust
pub trait Subscriber {
    fn calculate_bill(&self) -> i32;
}
```

The `Subscriber` trait defines the `calculate_bill` method as a contract that any subscriber type must fulfill. This trait acts as the **extension point** in the design: new subscriber types can implement this trait to extend functionality (for example, to calculate bills differently for various subscriber types).

Because of this, the `Subscriber` trait itself **remains closed for modification**—no changes need to be made to it when adding new subscriber types. It allows the addition of any number of new subscriber types without altering existing code in the trait.

#### 2. Using `SubscriberDetails` as a Reusable Struct

```rust
pub struct SubscriberDetails {
    pub subscriber_id: String,
    pub address: String,
    pub phone_number: String,
    pub base_rate: i32,
}
```

The `SubscriberDetails` struct is used to store common fields for subscribers, like `subscriber_id`, `address`, `phone_number`, and `base_rate`. This struct is a **reusable data structure** that both `PhoneSubscriber` and `ISPSubscriber` can use.

Since `SubscriberDetails` provides shared data, you avoid code duplication between `PhoneSubscriber` and `ISPSubscriber` for these fields. This struct **supports the Open/Closed Principle by acting as a base structure that remains closed for modification** while being flexible enough to be reused.

#### 3. Implementing `Subscriber` for `PhoneSubscriber`

```rust
pub struct PhoneSubscriber {
    details: SubscriberDetails,
}

impl Subscriber for PhoneSubscriber {
    fn calculate_bill(&self) -> i32 {
        self.details.base_rate * 2
    }
}
```

The `PhoneSubscriber` struct represents a specific type of subscriber. By implementing the `Subscriber` trait for `PhoneSubscriber`, you are **extending the functionality** to calculate bills specifically for phone subscribers.

The `calculate_bill` method in this implementation multiplies the `base_rate` by 2. This implementation of `calculate_bill` is unique to `PhoneSubscriber` and fulfills the contract defined by `Subscriber` without modifying the original `Subscriber` trait.

#### 4. Implementing `Subscriber` for `ISPSubscriber`

```rust
pub struct ISPSubscriber {
    details: SubscriberDetails,
    free_usage: i32,
}

impl Subscriber for ISPSubscriber {
    fn calculate_bill(&self) -> i32 {
        self.details.base_rate * 2
    }
}
```

The `ISPSubscriber` struct represents another type of subscriber, with its own fields and behavior. It has an additional `free_usage` field specific to ISP subscribers, which `PhoneSubscriber` doesn’t have.

By implementing the `Subscriber` trait for `ISPSubscriber`, you add new functionality for calculating bills for ISP subscribers without modifying any of the existing code in `Subscriber` or in `PhoneSubscriber`. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle by allowing ISP-specific bill calculation to be added in a separate implementation.

#### 5. Main Function and Modules

```rust
mod phone_subscriber;
mod isp_subscriber;
mod subscriber;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Here, the `main` function initializes the modules (`phone_subscriber`, `isp_subscriber`, and `subscriber`). Though you aren't creating instances of `PhoneSubscriber` and `ISPSubscriber` in this code, you could extend `main` to create instances and calculate bills as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let phone_subscriber = phone_subscriber::PhoneSubscriber {
        details: subscriber::SubscriberDetails {
            subscriber_id: String::from("P123"),
            address: String::from("1234 Elm St"),
            phone_number: String::from("555-1234"),
            base_rate: 10,
        },
    };

    let isp_subscriber = isp_subscriber::ISPSubscriber {
        details: subscriber::SubscriberDetails {
            subscriber_id: String::from("I456"),
            address: String::from("5678 Maple Ave"),
            phone_number: String::from("555-5678"),
            base_rate: 15,
        },
        free_usage: 100,
    };

    println!("Phone Subscriber Bill: {}", phone_subscriber.calculate_bill());
    println!("ISP Subscriber Bill: {}", isp_subscriber.calculate_bill());
}
```

### How the Code Adheres to the Open/Closed Principle

- **Open for Extension**: You can add new subscriber types (e.g., `PremiumSubscriber` or `BusinessSubscriber`) by implementing the `Subscriber` trait for each new type. These new types can have their unique `calculate_bill` logic without changing any existing code.

- **Closed for Modification**: The `Subscriber` trait and `SubscriberDetails` struct do not need to be modified to support new types of subscribers. Both `PhoneSubscriber` and `ISPSubscriber` adhere to the `Subscriber` trait, fulfilling the contract of `calculate_bill` without requiring any changes to the `Subscriber` trait itself.

In this way, your code remains flexible and extensible without risking regressions or bugs in existing logic. This approach makes it easy to introduce new behaviors through additional types without modifying existing, stable code.
